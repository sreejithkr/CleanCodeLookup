# Name++: 

This chapter in the clean code talks about how to be effective in naming. The main highlights of the video is summarised as the following.    
1.  One should alway be thoughtful of choosing a name (variable name, function name, class name etc)
2. Intent should be clearly communicated from the name. This would mean that there is need for reduced documentation or comment. 
3. Avoid Disinformation
4. Avoid Encoding and short form
5. Choose part of speech well
6. The scope rule.  

Quick Bytes and pointer to understand if we are not naming correctly: 
* Whenever one have to read the code in order to understand a name, the name has pretty much failed to communicate
* Names are not for convenience. They are your primary tool for communicating intent
* If you have to go look in the comment to understand a name, you're using the wrong name
* Ignore and avoid silly little noise words like Manager, or Processor, or Data, or Info. Noise words like that are just synonyms for, "I don't know what to call this.”
